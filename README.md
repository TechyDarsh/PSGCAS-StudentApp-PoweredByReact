Student-App Revamp // PSGCAS - PSG College of Arts and Science
This idea came from PSGCAS students who couldn't access important college information on their iPhones. They had to rely on friends with Android phones for help, which wasn't always easy. So, I decided to fix it by updating the Student-App to work on both iPhone and Android. This way, everyone could use it and no one would feel left out,
Recognizing the importance of digital access in today's educational landscape. As students, we rely heavily on our mobile phones for various tasks, from paying fees to downloading hall tickets and accessing important circulars. It was unfair that such essential functions were limited to Android users, leaving iOS users feeling helpless.
